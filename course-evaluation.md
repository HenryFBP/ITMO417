# Course Eval

## Instructor

5/5

Sam is a very caring and calm professor. His homework is logical, linearly difficult, and he gives fair warning for due dates.

He explains concepts in a humorous and relatable way, and for every concept that he explains, he will include an example.

## Course

4/5

This course teaches good `bash`, `powershell`, and `perl` knowledge. However, I believe it is too easy for a 400 level course. This opinion is kind of biased as I enjoy software dev as a hobby.

This is a good course for moderate-easy shell scripting. It teaches:

- control structures
- environment variables
- command-line syntax & tools
- functions
- code organization

I think that an evolution of this project could potentially be a live server environment where shell scripts run in a production-like environment, perhaps for a 500-level class.
