Rewrite your midterm “Customize add login id script” from bash to Perl Language
The Linux command useradd allows a system administrator to create login accounts. The
following is an example of how to use the command (must be in superuser mode);
    useradd smithj –m -c "John Smith, Scripting Course" –u 1001 –g 1001 –s /bin/bash

The command above adds a login id called smithj to the Linux system, make the home directory
for smithj, the owner is John Smith with comment included as Scripting Course, with User ID
number (UID) 1001, Group ID (GID) number 1001, and setup the bash shell for user smithj.

Your Assignment

Customize and write a script to add new login id in an interactive mode. Your script should ask
the user what Linux id to install, the user full name, what UID and GID to use (if nothing is
entered for UID and GID, your Linux will use the default values), and what Linux shell to use
(default should be setup as bash). Once you have all the values, your script will then implement
the Linux useradd command to complete the task. Call your script addloginid.

This assignment requires super-user access to run your script. This assignment must be written
using your Linux server that you have installed earlier as one of your assignments. If you did not
install it, then you will not be able to do this assignment.

Your script MUST check all possible errors. The script will terminate if an error is
encountered. Your script should check for the following possible errors:

    a) Only superuser can run the script.
    b) Duplicate Linux id should NOT be allowed.
    c) Linux id should have a minimum of three characters.
    The shell selected should only be either c, ksh, sh, or bash.
    d) User full name should not be blank.
    e) Make sure your script sets up a default password (any password).
    f) Make sure the id has a default .bash_profile file.
    g) Any other possible errors you can think of? Make your script robust!

Submit your script with several test results. Include successful output and failure output.
Demonstrate that you have done a thorough test on your script.
