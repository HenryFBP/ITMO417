## Question #2

Suppose you are given the following arrays containing participant information:
```perl
  @firstnames = ("Sarah", "Jareth", "Ludo", "Hoggle");
  @lastnames = ("Williams", "King", "Beast", "Dwarf");
  @ages = (15, 39, 33, 43);
  @nativelanguages = ("English", "English", "Romanian", "English");
  @performancescores = (85, 99, 35, 75); 
```

Write a script that calculates the average performance score and prints out the members of the groups meeting the following criteria (each criterion should produce one group, rather than identifying a group that meets all four criteria): 

a. Native language is English

b. Age is greater than 20

c. Age is greater than 20 and native language is English

d. Performance score is greater than 70
